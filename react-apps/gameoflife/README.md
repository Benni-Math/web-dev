# Conway's Game of Life in React

Based on [freecodecamp](https://github.com/charlee/react-gameoflife) and [andreacarrara](https://github.com/andreacarrara/game-of-life).

Trying to make as many decoupled, general components as possible, so that I can have a running 'component library',
which I will also use for other simulations, like the caries ABM or the Shorelark genetic algorithm.
